### Real Time Kinematics & Head Tracking Monitor

This project belongs to the [RTKBaseStation](https://github.com/audio-communication-group/RTKBaseStation) and [RTKRover](https://github.com/audio-communication-group/RTKRover) projects and monitors the rover data. This iOS demonstrator receives location- (ZED-F9P) and orientation (BNO080) data via BLE from an ESP32 (RTKRover). The iOS device location and the RTKRover location are logged to console and the distance between both coordinates will be displayed. 

Written in Swift with Xcode V14.0.1 and tested on an iPhone 7 running iOS 15.6.
